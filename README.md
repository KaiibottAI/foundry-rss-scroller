# FoundryVTT RSS Journal Text Scroller

## Overview

Do your Edgerunners watch the Corpo news propaganda that gets spread about them after their Friday Night Firefights? What about the weather before a road trip across the badlands? Is there a sale for the latest and greatest in Mr Stud or Midnight Lady technology your players have been looking for? Are there new deals for drinks at the local bar? Well now you can see it all laid out --- with a live news ticker in FoundryVTT! Feed your table in-universe headlines, corporate spin, or underground rumors straight from your journal entries. If you write it, the ticker runs it.Â 

The FoundryVTT RSS Scroller is a module that creates a scrolling text window in FoundryVTT using journal entries as the source for RSS-style news feeds. The feed is fully customizable, allowing adjustment to the theme, font size, scrolling speed, window dimensions, and more.

| Setting | Description | Default |
| :-: | - | :-: |
| RSS Scroller Theme | Change the colour theme of the RSS Scroller. There are three options available right now, CyberpunkRED, Deep Blue and Fallout Terminal Green | CyberpunkRED | 
| RSS Scroller Title | The title of the RSS Scroller window that will show to the players | "RSS Scroller" | 
| Journal Name | The Journal name where the RSS Scroller will retrieve information from. This RSS Scroller does respect any html code you may have for the text, for example bolding and italics. Does not respect images linked in the journal.| "News Feed" |
| Fixed RSS Size or Draggable? | Toggle for if the RSS Scroller should be resizable on the fly or if you prefer rigid numbers of the height and width | False |
| Width | The default width of the RSS Scroller window | 800 |
| Height | The default height of the RSS Scroller window | 100 |
| Font Size | The default font size of the RSS Scroller text | 40 |
| RSS Speed | The speed of the RSS Scroller text. Lower number = Faster speed | 20 |
| RSS Font | List of Fonts available for the Scroller to use. Uses the default Foundry Font listing | Orbital |

## How Does It Works?

The module reads the text from a specified journal entry in the game settings. It processes the text content, stripping unnecessary HTML tags, paragraghs and page breaks, and formatting it into a continuous scrolling ticker. The scroller applies Foundry settings to modify its appearance and behavior and is animated with CSS to create a seamless scrolling effect. Great for having news given back to your players about things happening in your world!

#### Future Enhancements

- Support for multiple feeds and cycling between them.
- Successfully added Themes in 1.1.1! 
    - ~~Additional customization options (e.g., text color, background color).~~
    - ~~Themes~~

#### Troubleshooting

- Journal entry not found? Double-check the name in the settings (case-sensitive).
    - Double check the name you have in the RSS Scroller setting `Journal Name`, capitalization does matter. "News Feed" is not equal to "news feed".
- Text scrolling too fast/slow?
    -  Adjust the RSS Speed setting to a higher number. This controls "how long" the text will take to scroll thru the feed. Higher number = Slower speed.
- Window size not right?
    -  Modify the Width and Height settings or toggle the "resizeable" setting on for more control.
